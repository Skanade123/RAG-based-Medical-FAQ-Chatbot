üè• Medical FAQ Assistant with RAG
A secure, AI-powered medical FAQ assistant built with Streamlit and Google's Gemini AI. This application uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate medical information based on a curated medical knowledge base.
üîç What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
RAG is an AI architecture that enhances language models by combining:
1.	Retrieval: Searching through a knowledge base to find relevant information
2.	Augmentation: Adding retrieved context to the AI prompt
3.	Generation: Using an LLM to generate responses based on the retrieved context
How RAG Works in This Application:
User Query ‚Üí Embed Query ‚Üí Search FAISS Index ‚Üí Retrieve Medical Chunks ‚Üí 
Generate Response with Context ‚Üí Return Answer + Sources
Benefits of RAG:
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Provides factual, grounded responses from medical data
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Reduces AI hallucinations by using verified sources
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Enables domain-specific medical knowledge
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Allows for source attribution and transparency
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Can be updated without retraining models

üìã Prerequisites
‚Ä¢	Python 3.8 or higher
‚Ä¢	Google AI API Key from Google AI Studio
‚Ä¢	CSV dataset with medical FAQ data in format: qtype,Question,Answer
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/comprehensive-medical-q-a-dataset/data)
downlode the dataset and put it in data folder
	We are taking first 100 entries as we are using free version of google API
üîí Security Architecture
This application implements multiple security layers:
Data Processing Security (utils.py)
‚Ä¢	Input Validation: Filters records containing suspicious patterns
‚Ä¢	Content Sanitization: Blocks malicious instructions in dataset
‚Ä¢	Column Standardization: Safe handling of different CSV formats
Application Security (app.py)
‚Ä¢	Query Sanitization: Regex-based blocking of prompt injection attempts
‚Ä¢	Rate Limiting: 10 requests per minute per session
‚Ä¢	Session Management: 30-minute timeout with unique session IDs
‚Ä¢	Content Filtering: Removes suspicious chunks from retrieval results
‚Ä¢	Size Limits: Maximum 500 characters per query
Security Patterns Blocked:
