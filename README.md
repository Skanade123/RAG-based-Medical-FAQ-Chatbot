# RAG-based-Medical-FAQ-Chatbot
Meet our Medical FAQ RAG Assistant! Traditional AI often hallucinates medical facts, but our system solves this by using Retrieval-Augmented Generation - it searches through real medical data before answering. We've built this with Google Gemini for embeddings and chat, FAISS for lightning-fast vector search, and Streamlit for a interface.
